These objectives must be fulfilled by all architectures and demos
- All demos connect to Architectures connect to the Story
- All demos are modular  
[discussion of what this looks like] 
- All architectures are modular
- All architectures are product and platform agnostic  
this includes automation tooling
[F5 specific products on specific platforms show up in the demos3]
- All Solution Engineers are able to run all demos
- Application / IT Service Architectures must be relevant to customers
- All demos exhibit the following practices of speed:
  - version control of all code and configuration
  - deployment automation
  - test automation
  - shift left on security
  - loosely coupled architecture
  - pro-active notification
